# rules tat govern naming of variables
#a name given to a partition through programing is called a variabke 
num1= 65 #num1 is avariable
num2 = 100 #num2 is avariable
print(num1)
print(num1 + num2)
print(num2 - num1)
#the name of the variable should not start with special character eg # @ 
#compound variable means names should not have spces en num 1
#compound variable names should be joined by either un underscore or camel case eg num_1 or num1
#avoid ising capital letters to name variables eg Num1
#dont use special words as variable names eg print, if, else, while, for, etc
#python is case sensitive eg Num1 is different from num1
#a complete instruction to a computer is called a statement(lines 3,4,5,6)
# a statement that evaluates to a result is called an expression eg num1 + num2
# a python file is called a script
# a group of statements is called code
# a group of related code is called a block
# anamed block of code is called a function
# a function is a named block of code that exxcecutes a particular task
