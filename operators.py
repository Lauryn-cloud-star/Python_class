# = is an assignmeent operator because it tells the 
# 100 is an operand
# an opperator is a character or symbol that tells the computer what to do with an operand or value
# types of operstors in python include:
# arithmetic operators eg +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# comparison operators eg ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
# logical operators eg and, or, not
# assignment operators eg =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
#!= stands for not equal to
# ** stands for power
#// means floor division (it gives the integer value)
# / gives the float value( it gives the decimal value)
#* stands for multiplication
# modulus also means reminder
# bitwise operators eg &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# special operators eg is, is not, in, not in
#the / gives a float value
# the // gives an integer value
# the ** is the power operator
# when you are interested in the reminder you use (%)
# (%) is also known as the modulous
# a smaller number didived by a larger number gives back the smaller number


#arithmetic operators
num1 = 20
num2 = 40
print(num1 + num2)
print(num1 - num2)
print(num1 * num2)
print(num1 / num2)
print(num1 // num2)
print(num1 ** num2) #num1 to the power of num2
print(num1 % num2)  
print(num2 % num1)

#assinment operators
num3 = 50
num3 += 10 # it means get the value of num3 plus 10
print(num3)
num3 -= 10  
print(num3)
num3 *= 2  
print(num3)
num3 /= 5
print(num3)
num3 %= 3
print(num3)
num3 **= 3
print(num3)
